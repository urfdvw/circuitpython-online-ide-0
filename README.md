# CircuitPython online IDE V0.1

Open the IDE: https://urfdvw.github.io/circuitpython-online-ide-0/

## Why
The goal is to provide a CircuitPython IDE with **Zero-Setup**, that can be helpful for
- anyone that wants to start/work on a project quickly
- people who are working on public computers
- teachers don't expect students to install anything by themselves

## Features
- Runs on any device with the Chrome browser, including Chromebooks, or Chromium based browsers such as MS Edge
- Serial Console for communication and Read-Evaluate-Print loop (REPL)
- Serial data plotter
- Code editor with Python highlighting
- Editor's REPL mode keepboard shortcuts
- History command recall
- Auto completion
- Auto change shortcuts in MacOS
- Multiple file tabs
- change unsaved indicator
- 中文界面

## Workflow (a.k.a. How to use)

*This guide assumes that CircuitPython is already installed. About how to install CircuitPython to supported devices, please check [CircuitPython Website](https://circuitpython.org/downloads).*

### First of First
- Plugin your CircuitPython supported board, and make sure it shows up as a drive.
    - There should **NOT** be a `.uf2` file in the drive.
        - If so, that means you are in boot mode, where CircuitPython is installed.
        - To exist boot mode, try:
            - clicking the `reset` button on the board
            - Plug and unplug the board
- If there is not a `code.py` or `main.py` file, create a text file called `code.py`.
    - This file can be downloaded from our IDE by click on `Save as`
- **Open the [CircuitPython online IDE](https://urfdvw.github.io/circuitpython-online-ide-0/). Then connect your CircuitPython supported board by click the `Connect` button**

### Script mode
- Once plugin the CircuitPython supported board, the initial mode is 'Script mode' which will run the saved script file `code.py` or `main.py`.
- To switch back to 'Script mode' from 'REPL' mode, Click on the `CTRL-D` button on the UI, whitch sends the `0x04` signal to the board. 
- Click on the `Open` button on the UI to open the code file on the CircuitPython supported board.
    - Opening the file will remove everything in the Editor. Click on the `Save as` button to backup the code before opening it if necessary
- After editing, click on `Save and Run` button on the UI or `Ctrl-S` on the keyboard to save the code to the original file.
    - This will trigger the board to reset and start to run the code.
- If necessary, click on the `Save as` button to download the edited code as a separate file.
- Command window can be used for serial communication in the 'Script mode', such as feeding inputs when `input('message')` is used.

### REPL mode
- Click on the `CTRL-C` button on the UI (which sends the `0x03` signal to the board) to start the REPL mode.
    - You might need to click for more than one time. Stop until you see `>>>` in the terminal.
- Write one or multiple lines of code in the Command window. Hit `Enter` on the keyboard to send the command(s) to the board.
    - When writing multiple lines, use `Shift-Enter` to create a newline 
    - The button on the right bottom in the UI is used to switch the keyboard shortcuts of 'send' and 'newline'.
- In the Editor: write one or multiple lines of code.
    - Hit `Shift-Enter` on the keyboard to run the current line.
        - The cursor will move to the following line, so keep on hitting to run a sequence of lines.
    - Select multiple lines of code, then hit `Shift-Enter` on the keyboard to run the selected code.
    - Hit `Ctrl-Enter` on the keyboard to run the current 'Cell' in REPL.
        - Cells are multiple lines of codes starts with `#%%`.
- In the Command window, use keyboard button `Up` and `Down` to recall command history.
- Click on the `Save as` button on the Editor UI to download the code in the Editor as a separate file.
- Click on the `Save log` button on the Serial UI to download the serial conversation log as a text file.

### Plot
- Click on the [Plot] button to toggle plot window
- You need to start the plot by **serial output** `startplot: xname y1name y2name ...`, separated by space.
    - In python, this is done by `print("startplot:", "xname", "y1name", "y2name")`.
- Plot data should immediately follow the start line in the **serial output**. Each line should contain the data of one timestep, `xdata y1data y2data ...`, separated by space.
    - In python, this is done by `print(xdata, y1data, y2data)`, where `xdata` and alike are `int` or `float` variables.
- Check the box [x-axis] in the IDE to use the first dimension as the x-axis.
Otherwise, all dimensions of the data are considered as paralleled y-axes,
and the x-axis on the figure is going to be the index.
- Plot can be real-time or off-line.
- Example **python** code for plotting:

```python
#%% imports
import math
from time import sleep
from time import monotonic as time

#%% set
time_start = time()

#%% loop
# the start indicator and labels
# separated by `,` in `print()`
print('startplot:', 't*cos(t)', 't*sin(t)')
for i in range(100):
    sleep(0.1)
    t = time() - time_start
    # print the data for plotting
    # dimensions separated by `,` in `print()`
    print(t*math.cos(t), t*math.sin(t))
# please check and uncheck the [x-axis] box to see the difference.
```
